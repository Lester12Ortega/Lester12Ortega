## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a front-end intern currently learning how to build modern, responsive web applications using Next.js and styled-components. This repository is a collection of my practice projects, experiments, and personal notes as I grow more comfortable working with these powerful tools.

Next.js has opened up a lot of new possibilities for me in terms of performance and scalability. I'm learning how to build server-rendered and statically generated pages, handle routing, and create optimized React-based applications. Whether it's improving SEO or understanding dynamic page rendering, each project helps deepen my understanding of how real-world front-end apps are structured.

Alongside Next.js, Iâ€™m exploring styled-components to write modular, scoped styles using CSS-in-JS. I really enjoy the flexibility it offersâ€”being able to keep styles close to components while still maintaining clean, maintainable code. Iâ€™m practicing how to use themes, style props, and reusable components to build consistent, polished interfaces.

This repository includes small to medium-sized projects like landing pages, UI components, and full-page layoutsâ€”all built with an emphasis on clean structure, responsiveness, and readability. Iâ€™m also getting into version control, deployment basics, and performance optimization as part of my learning process.

As I continue to grow, my focus is on writing clean, well-organized code and developing a strong foundation in front-end architecture. I believe that hands-on practice and sharing what I learn are key parts of becoming a better developer.

If you're also learning Next.js or styled-components, feel free to check out my code, give feedback, or connectâ€”Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and learning from others.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building better UIs, one component at a time.
